# Train-Scheduler

This application is operable to display arrival times at a station for a series of trains.  The page includes a section that lists each train, its destination, the frequency at which it arrives at the station, the train's next arrival time, and the number of minutes the train is away from arriving at the station.

The application includes another section that allows the user to add a new train to the list. The section prompts a user to enter the train name, destination, first train time, and frequency at which the train arrives at the station.
